The underlying noun roots are identical to the bare noun. There is a lenition rule:
[-cor,-voice] → [-cons] / [+syl] ___
This formulation depends on notions of structure preservation, crucially assuming a
characterization of w as the [+labial] glide corresponding to /p/ and j as the [-labial] glide
corresponding to /k/.

2. Kikuria
There is a vowel harmony rule where a high vowel becomes a mid vowel before a
mid vowel (disregarding consonants), so that /huut-er-a/ becomes [hootera].

[+syl] → [-hi] / __ C0 [+syl,-hi]
