1. Axininca Campa
The underlying noun roots are identical to the bare noun. There is a lenition rule:
[-cor,-voice] → [-cons] / [+syl] ___
This formulation depends on notions of structure preservation, crucially assuming a
characterization of w as the [+labial] glide corresponding to /p/ and j as the [-labial] glide
corresponding to /k/.

2. Kikuria

There is a vowel harmony rule where a high vowel becomes a mid vowel before a
mid vowel (disregarding consonants), so that /huut-er-a/ becomes [hootera].

[+syl] → [-hi] / __ C0 [+syl,-hi]

3. Korean

The underlying roots are /ip, kup, kaph
, ciph
, tat, puth
, mək, čuk, ik, tak’, k’ak’, sək’/. All

consonants neutralize to plain unaspirated before another consonant.
[-son] → [-s.g., -c.g] / ___ C
